# Crawler 

## Overview

Crawler is a web scraper who pulls the data from websites using Selenium and its web drivers. In here, I have used crawler to scrape all the locations *(longitudes and lattitudes)* of the restaurants near a location. 

Food Grab provides a list of all the restaurants which are located near your current location. We have to extract the locations (lattitudes and longitudes) with their respective names of all the restaurants near a given location.
